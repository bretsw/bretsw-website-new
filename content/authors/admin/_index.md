# Hi, I'm Bret.

I am an Assistant Professor of [Instructional Systems & Learning Technologies](https://education.fsu.edu/instructional-systems-and-learning-technologies) at Florida State University.

My research investigates **self-directed learning through social media**. I have several ongoing projects related to this research area. First, I examine networked learning in online communities, such as those hosted by Twitter and Reddit. Second, I study how new teachers expand their professional support systems during their induction transition. Third, I explore the connections between informal learning and invisible labor.

![Bret's areas of research](/img/research-areas.jpg)

I hold a [Ph.D. in Educational Psychology & Educational Technology](https://education.msu.edu/cepse/epet/), a [Master's Degree in Educational Technology](https://education.msu.edu/cepse/maet/), and a [Graduate Certificate in Serious Game Design and Research](https://comartsci.msu.edu/academics/academic-departments/media-information/graduate/serious-game-design-ma-certificate) from Michigan State University, and a dual bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Sociology from Bucknell University. 

I consider my strongest credential to be my ongoing friendship with my very first online friend, who I met in an AOL chatroom in the early 1990s.
