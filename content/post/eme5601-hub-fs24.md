This page compiles all of my slide decks as I teach *EME5601: Introduction to Instructional Systems* at Florida State University. Enjoy!

## Course Description

The goal of this course is for you to develop adequate knowledge of the systematic approach to instructional design, the contexts of application of this approach, and the roles of professionals in this field to be able to adapt and apply the process in a flexible and innovative manner, especially to large-scale projects.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Analyze and describe an organization in systems terms.
- Compare and contrast ISD models in terms of their appropriateness for a given set of education or training development requirements.
- Prepare a plan for conducting a front-end analysis that covers needs assessment, learner analysis, and environmental analysis.
- Conduct a job/task analysis for a portion of a job and determine what tasks, skills, attitudes, and areas of knowledge require training.
- Produce an ISD process that is tailored to the education and training requirements of a specific organization.
