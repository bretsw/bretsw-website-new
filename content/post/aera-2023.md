## Social Media’s Impact on Instruction: Beginning Teachers’ Self-Directed Professional Learning

**Bret Staudt Willet**

### Keywords

*beginning teachers, early-career teachers, self-directed learning, professional learning networks, pedagogical content knowledge, social media*

### Purpose

Beginning teachers face numerous challenges as they start their careers.

Through qualitative research, I explore social media’s impact on beginning teachers’ instructional practice.
