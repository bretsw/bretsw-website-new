## The Torch Magazine - Spotlight

![Learning Without Limits article title page](/images/learning-without-limits.png)

I was really grateful to be featured in a spotlight article in *The Torch* magazine by Melissa Powell, Communications Manager for the College of Education, Health, and Human Sciences. She did an excellent job interviewing me and compiling our conversation in the article [Learning Without Limits](https://issuu.com/fsu_education/docs/thetorchspring24_finaldigital) (2024, pp. 16-19).

## Video Interview

In addition to the print article, Serina Williams, Media Specialist for the College of Education, Health, and Human Sciences, captured and edited a video of highlights from my interview. I appreciate her work to make me look good.
