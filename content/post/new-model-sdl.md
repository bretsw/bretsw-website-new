## Overview

Along with [Hunhui Na](https://hunhuina.wixsite.com/), I have been working on developing an updated model for self-directed learning. The **context-aware self-teaching (CAST)** model conceptualizes performance as a journey with six key features to keep in mind:

- Performance objective
- Starting context
- Exploration
- Difficulty level
- Content area
- External guides

We wrote a chapter about CAST in the Spanish-language volume *Teachers and Social Media: Collaboration and Learning Dynamics in the Digital Environment* edited by [Dr. Paula Marcelo-Martínez](https://sites.google.com/view/paulamarcelo/) and published by the University of Sevilla.

The English-language version of the chapter is available [through Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/8K3T4).
