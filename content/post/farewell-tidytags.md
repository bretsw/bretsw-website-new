I am sad to announce that [Josh Rosenberg](https://joshuamrosenberg.com/) and I have decided to archive our R package, **tidytags**. After the many changes to X/Twitter in the past year, and especially the changes to the API, continuing API access has become cost prohibitive for academics. As a result, it is impossible for us to further maintain or support the package.

You can still access the archived package and use tidytags, if you like. The full tidytags package can be accessed through the [rOpenSci archive](https://github.com/ropensci-archive/tidytags).

In the end, tidytags went through an epic peer review process and was downloaded **2,540** times. Here is a screenshot of the dashboard just before archviving:

And now, the current state of tidytags:
