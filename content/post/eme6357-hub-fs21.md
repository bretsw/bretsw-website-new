I wanted a place to compile all of my slide decks as I teach *EME6357: Evaluation of Instruction & Training in Human-Performance Technology* at Florida State University. Enjoy!

## Course Description

This course focuses on the evaluation of training and instruction through a systemic analysis of the organization sponsoring the training program. The course also provides the knowledge and skills for conducting an HPT-based evaluation of training systems. Students actively participate in discussions, presentations, synthesis of materials, and the writing of papers.

## Learning Objectives

At the completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Identify the characteristics of training programs in the context of Human Performance Technology (HPT).
2. Describe theoretical foundations of evaluation and their application to organizational performance environment through class participation and discussions.
3. Discuss the dominant approaches to evaluation of training through class presentations.
4. Analyze a training system and produce a series of evaluation questions as drivers of design and development of evaluation.
5. Develop a training evaluation plan by proposing appropriate analysis, methodology, implementation and communication approaches.
6. Synthesize the proposed activities into an evaluation proposal as the final class project.
