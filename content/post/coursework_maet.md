In 2015, I completed a Master of Arts degree in [Educational Technology](http://edutech.msu.edu/programs/masters/) through Michigan State University's College of Education. Here I offer a bit of my experience in each course.  
*The "CEP" before the course number stands for "Counseling, Educational Psychology, and Special Education," the name of the department in the College of Education."*

## CEP 800: Psychology of Learning in School and Other Settings  
*Summer 2013*  
**Instructors:** [Dr. Hannah Klautke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannah-klautke-00bbb96/), [Dr. Sean Leahy](https://www.seanmleahy.com/)  

In CEP 800, I learned a broad overview of learning theories and how to understand student understanding. I evaluated technologies for teaching and learning and I studied how to craft powerful learning experiences, immersion, and supporting special needs. I created multimodal pieces of work including an audio interview a digital storytelling piece. For the final project of this course I conducted an action research project; I planned and implemented a staff meeting plan that used technology to facilitate a collaborative mind-mapping activity.

## CEP 822: Approaches to Educational Research  
*Summer 2013*  
**Instructors:** [Dr. Tatyana Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tatyana-li-3b2897132/), [Dr. David Wong](https://sites.google.com/a/msu.edu/e-david-wong-ph-d/)  

In CEP 822, I learned a broad overview of research methods for education, including literature review, qualitative methods, quantitative methods, and statistical analysis. I completed short projects to evaluate research designs, explore research ethics, and examine both external and internal research validity. I designed and conducted a survey, which included collecting, coding, and analyzing data. I used Microsoft Excel for basic statistical analysis of datasets, including graphing, means and standard deviations, z-scores (standardized variables), t-tests, correlation, and probability. For the final project of this course I completed a research review project of the intersection of college undergraduates, money, and technology.

## CEP 815: Technology and Leadership  
*Summer 2014*  
**Instructors:** [Dr. Benjamin Gleason](http://www.education.iastate.edu/people/core-faculty/faculty/bgleason.html), [Dr. Leigh Graves Wolf](http://www.leighgraveswolf.com/)  

In CEP 815, I learned at the intersection of Harvard Business Review leadership practices and strategic technology uses for learning. I learned the difference between instrumental and missional thinking, that is, the difference between using a technology for its own sake (focused on the instrument) and selecting technologies as tools to solve specific problems (focused on the mission). I was introduced to two powerful tools for evaluating educational technologies, TPACK (Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge) and SAMR (Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, Redefinition). I compiled a personal manifesto, a collection of resources that have been essential to my professional work as a startup leader of ministry in digital spaces. For the final project of this course I wrote a paper that included a policy brief, a literature review, a synthesis of learning, and a sustainability statement for ministry in digital spaces. 

## CEP 818: Creativity in Teaching and Learning  
*Fall 2014*  
**Instructors:** [Dr. Punya Mishra](http://www.punyamishra.com/), [Dr. Rohit Mehta](http://mehtarohit.com/)  

In CEP 818, I learned about using creative thinking tools for teaching and learning experiences that are NEW (Novel, Effective, and Whole). I practiced quite a bit of video editing as I made digital storytelling pieces for each of these creative thinking tools in order to examine community from many angles. I perceived community through the lens of an iconic dinner party, I looked at the patterns of community as communication spreads in a nonlinear, patchwork saturation effect, and I abstracted community into the resiliency of a wave and ripples. I reflected on how community is embodied while talking on the phone (smiles, stress, and so on), I modeled community through the effects of mediated communication, and I created an opportunity to play with the idea of mediated communication by developing a videogame. For the final project of this course I wrote a created a final video for an elevator pitch and wrote a synthesis white paper summarizing how these new understandings about community inform ministry in digital spaces. 

## CEP 817: Learning Technology through Design  
*Spring 2015*  
**Instructors:** [Dr. Danah Henriksen](http://danah-henriksen.com/), [Dr. Jon Good](http://jon-good.com/), [Carmen Richardson](https://carmenrichardson.com/)

In CEP 817, I learned at the intersection of the Stanford Design Model and educational technology. Throughout the entire course I used Stanford’s toolkit of design methods to explore the problem of young staff learning ministry in digital spaces. I empathized with these young staff by conducting interviews and observing social media, and I defined the problem through a root-cause analysis and a why-how ladder. I ideated possibilities through both active and passive techniques, and I created a paper prototype for a mobile app that would provide personal coaching to young staff. I turned the paper prototype into a digital one using Twine, and invited a handful of staff to test it. For the final project of this course I wrote a design report that reflected on what each step of the design process taught me about this problem of practice.

## CEP 811: Adapting Innovative Technologies to Education  
*Summer 2015*  
**Instructors:** [Melissa White](https://mjwhite61.weebly.com/), [Janine Campbell](http://janinecampbell.weebly.com/)

In CEP 811, I learned how to use the act of making to develop compelling teaching and learning. I studied the Makers Movement and makerspaces, looking at learning theories in the work of remixing and repurposing. I learned how to use the Raspberry Pi and the possibilities it creates for designing learning experiences. For the final project of this course I wrote a reflection paper to summarize what I had learned from making with the Raspberry Pi.

## CEP 807: Capstone in Educational Technology  
*Summer 2015*  
**Instructors:** [Dr. Matthew Koehler](http://www.matt-koehler.com/), [Dr. Spencer Greenhalgh](http://www.spencergreenhalgh.com/)

In CEP 807, I learned about professional portfolios and web development, including FTP, HTML, PHP, and CSS. I wrote three reflections on my Master’s program experience: revisiting my original goals for the program, planning my future learning goals, and synthesizing everything I learned from these courses. I curated all my academic work into a showcase of my nine best projects and an extended gallery of all my digital projects. I significantly improved my social media presence through a resume on my website, a list of technological tools I regularly use, and my Linkedin and about.me profiles. For the final project of this course I compiled all of these pieces into a digital portfolio on a self-hosted Wordpress website.
