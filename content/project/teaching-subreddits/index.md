## Introduction

Reddit is an understudied social media platform with a large and international base of users. Reddit has more than 430 million average monthly active users globally and 130,000 active discussion forums, called *subreddits*. Among these many subreddits, several are education-focused, including 16 that comprise the Reddit Education Network. However, Redditâ€™s potential for hosting teaching-related discussions has been the subject of relatively little research compared to other social media platforms.
