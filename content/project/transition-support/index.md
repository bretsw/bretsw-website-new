## Introduction

New teachers face numerous decisions as they transition from teacher preparation into enacting practice (i.e., their induction period). They must reconcile conflicting messages about what and how to teach from the academic world of the preparation program and the practical world of their school of employment. Interviews with new teachers provide evidence of why new teachers seek supports for professional leaning to complement formal induction programs offered by schools and districts. Findings demonstrate how new teachersâ€™ agency is stretched as they navigate the edu-verse, a complex learning ecology of supports accessed locally and through social media.
