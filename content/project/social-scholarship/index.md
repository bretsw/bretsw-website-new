## Introduction

*Social scholarship* is a framework that takes into account how social media affect forms of scholarly activity including discovery and research, teaching and learning, integration, and application. Social scholarship continues to evolve in light of changing understandings in the field of educational technology and the role social media play in the academy. Recent examples of social scholarship include altmetrics, interdisciplinary projects, crowdsourced educational technology syllabi, and a reconsideration of the needs of research participants.
